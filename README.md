# Bayesian Network Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project involves building a **Bayesian Network** to analyze relationships between variables in three datasets: small, medium, and large. The **K2 search algorithm** was used to learn the network structure, and the model was evaluated based on the **Bayesian score**. The objective was to find optimal configurations for each dataset by achieving the best possible Bayesian score through parameter tuning and data preprocessing.

## Small Dataset

### Dataset Details:
The small dataset `small.csv` contains the following variables:
- `age`, `portembarked`, `fare`, `numparentschildren`, `passengerclass`, `sex`, `numsiblings`, `survived`

### Approach:
1. **K2 Search Algorithm**: 
   - Experimented with different values for `max_parents` (2, 4, 5) and `node_order`.
   - Bayesian score calculated to evaluate the network structure.
   
2. **Best Results**:
   - **Best Configuration**: `max_parents=4`, `node_order=[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - **Bayesian Score**: **-3798.45**

### Challenges:
- Adjustments were made to ensure correctness in Bayesian score calculation.
- Iterative experimentation to find the optimal network structure.

## Medium Dataset

### Dataset Details:
The medium dataset `medium.csv` contains variables such as `alcohol`, `fixedacidity`, and others. Binning was applied for more effective analysis.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - `alcohol` and `fixedacidity` were binned into 5 categories.
   - Missing values were handled by filling with the mode.

2. **K2 Search Algorithm**:
   - Performed K2 search with various parameters: `max_parents`, `node_order`, and **ESS** (Equivalent Sample Size).
   
3. **Best Results**:
   - **Best Configuration**: `max_parents=4`, `node_order=[3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`, **ESS=1.0**
   - **Bayesian Score**: **-97,320**

### Challenges:
- Proper binning and handling missing data were critical preprocessing steps.

## Large Dataset

### Dataset Details:
The large dataset `large.csv` contains 50 variables, with unique values for each variable ranging from 2 to 4.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by filling them with the mode.
   
2. **K2 Search Algorithm**:
   - Ran K2 search with extensive parameter tuning to identify the optimal Bayesian network structure.
   
3. **Best Results**:
   - **Best Configuration**: `max_parents=2`, `ESS=2.0`
   - **Bayesian Score**: **-478,354.55**

### Challenges:
- The large number of variables increased the computational complexity and runtime, but through careful parameter tuning, the best results were achieved.
